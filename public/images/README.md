# Background Images for Two-Column Layout

This folder should contain the background images that will change as users scroll through different sections of the wedding website.

## Required Images

For the best experience, add the following images to this folder:

1. `couple-hero.jpg` - A beautiful photo of the couple for the intro section
2. `venue.jpg` - A photo of the wedding venue for the timer section
3. `details.jpg` - An elegant image for the details section
4. `gallery-bg.jpg` - A romantic image for the gallery section
5. `info-bg.jpg` - A warm image for the info section
6. `gifts-bg.jpg` - A thoughtful image for the gifts section
7. `hashtag-bg.jpg` - A fun image for the hashtag section
8. `footer-bg.jpg` - A closing image for the footer section

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 2:3 (portrait orientation works best)
- **Minimum Size**: 800x1200 pixels

## Current Setup

- Choose images that complement each other in style and color
- Consider the text overlay - avoid busy backgrounds
